### 1 C++
C++ is a very popular language for performance-critical applications that rely on speed and efficient memory management. Itâ€™s used in a wide range of industries including software and game development, VR, robotics, and scientific computing. Why we love it: Fast and flexible, Low-level functionality, Large programming community, Strong documentation

40 years ago, a Ph.D. student by the name of Bjarne Stroustrup tinkered around with the C programming language, which was and still is a language well-respected for its flexibility and low-level functionality. Little did he know, he created a new language that can now be found in: Operating systems, Web browsers, Microcontrollers, Video games, And elsewhere!
